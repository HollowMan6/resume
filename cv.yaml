about: |
  <p align='justify'>
  I am a research scientist in the
  <b>Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</b>
  group at
  <b>Meta AI</b>
  in NYC and study foundational topics in <b>machine learning</b> and
  <b>optimization</b>, recently involving reinforcement learning, control,
  optimal transport, and geometry.
  My research is on learning systems that understand and interact with our world
  and focuses on integrating structural information and domain knowledge into
  these systems to represent non-trivial reasoning operations.
  A key theme of my work in this space involves the use of optimization as
  a differentiable building block in larger architectures that are end-to-end learned.
  I believe that science should be open and reproducible and
  freely publish my research code to \href{https://github.com/bamos}{GitHub}.
