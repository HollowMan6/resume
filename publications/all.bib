    In contemporary society, there are problems existed in the online voting
    systems such as repeated fraudulent voting, data tampering, loss of voting data,
    and failure to verify the outcome of the voting data, and these problems causes
    inconvenience to the users. Meanwhile, the mobile pay systems represented by
    Wechat pay are distinguished due to its safety and convenience. If we combine
    the voting system with Wechat pay, a huge difference will be made. My system
    is based on Wechat pay. When you want to vote, you just need to pay a little,
    then a refund will give to you to ensure that the voting is real. The system can
    double check the voting record by checking the trading record saved on the Wechat
    Sever. As a result, the system provides users with a safe and fair environment to
    vote and it also reduces the developing cost.
